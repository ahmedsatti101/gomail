# Gomail
Gomail is a command line application that aims to simulate, not replace, using Gmail in the command such as checking new emails, sending emails and searching for them.

I decided to build this project out of fun and curiosity to see if I could turn this from an idea to something that actually exists. This is also my first time using `Go` and learning about TUI libraries like [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main) and [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).
